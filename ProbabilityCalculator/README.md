### Probability Theory Fundamentals

#### Mutually Exclusive Events

- **Example**: Rolling a 1 OR a 6 on a die (cannot happen at same time)

#### Inclusive Events
- **Definition**: Events that can occur simultaneously
- **Formula**: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)
- **Example**: Drawing a red card OR a face card from a deck

#### Intersection Probability
- **Definition**: Probability of both events occurring together
- **Constraints**: 
  - P(A ‚à© B) ‚â§ min(P(A), P(B))
  - P(A ‚à© B) ‚â• max(0, P(A) + P(B) - 1)

## üìä Sample Output

### Mutually Exclusive Events Example
```
=== C# Probability Calculator ===
Calculate the probability of the union of two events

Formulas used:
‚Ä¢ Mutually Exclusive Events: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B)
‚Ä¢ Inclusive Events: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)

Select event type:
1. Mutually Exclusive Events
2. Inclusive Events
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1

--- Mutually Exclusive Events ---
Enter P(A) (probability of event A, 0 to 1): 0.3
Enter P(B) (probability of event B, 0 to 1): 0.4

=== Mutually Exclusive Events Calculation ===
P(A) = 0.3000 (30.00%)
P(B) = 0.4000 (40.00%)
Formula: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B)
Calculation: 0.3000 + 0.4000 = 0.7000
Result: P(A ‚à™ B) = 0.7000 (70.00%)

### Inclusive Events Example
```
Select event type:
1. Mutually Exclusive Events
2. Inclusive Events
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2

--- Inclusive Events ---
Enter P(A) (probability of event A, 0 to 1): 0.6
Enter P(B) (probability of event B, 0 to 1): 0.5
Enter P(A ‚à© B) (probability of both events occurring, 0 to 1): 0.2

=== Inclusive Events Calculation ===
P(A) = 0.6000 (60.00%)
P(B) = 0.5000 (50.00%)
P(A ‚à© B) = 0.2000 (20.00%)
Formula: P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)
Calculation: 0.6000 + 0.5000 - 0.2000 = 0.9000
Result: P(A ‚à™ B) = 0.9000 (90.00%)
